The reactor sofftware design pattern is an event handing strategy that can respond to many potential service requests concurrently.

The component is an event loop,runing in a single thread or process,which [demultiplexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demultiplex) incoming requests  and dispatches them to the correct request handler.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Schmidt_1995-1)

By relying on event-based mechanisms rather than [blocking I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_I/O "Blocking I/O") or multi-threading, a reactor can handle many concurrent [I/O bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_bound "I/O bound") requests with minimal delay.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Devresse_2014-2) A reactor also allows for easily modifying or expanding specific request handler routines, though the pattern does have some drawbacks and limitations.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Schmidt_1995-1)

With its balance of simplicity and [scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability "Scalability"), the reactor has become a central architectural element in several [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)") applications and [software frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework "Software framework") for [networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"). Derivations such as the **multireactor** and [proactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactor_pattern "Proactor pattern") also exist for special cases where even greater throughput, performance, or request complexity are necessary.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Schmidt_1995-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Devresse_2014-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Escoffier_2021-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Garrett_2015-4)

# Overview
Practical considerations for the [client–server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model") in large networks, such as the [C10k problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem "C10k problem") for [web servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server"), were the original motivation for the reactor pattern.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Kegel_2014-5)


A naive approach to handle service requests from many potential endpoints, such as [network sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket "Network socket") or [file descriptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor "File descriptor"), is to listen for new requests from within an event loop, then immediately [read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_(system_call) "Read (system call)") the earliest request. Once the entire request has been read, it can be processed and forwarded on by directly calling the appropriate handler. An entirely "iterative" server like this, which handles one request from start-to-finish per iteration of the event loop, is logically valid. However, it will fall behind once it receives multiple requests in quick succession. The iterative approach cannot scale because reading the request [blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(computing) "Blocking (computing)") the server's only thread until the full request is received, and I/O operations are typically much slower than other computations.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Devresse_2014-2)

One strategy to overcome this limitation is multi-threading: by immediately splitting off each new request into its own worker thread, the first request will no longer block the event loop, which can immediately iterate and handle another request. This "thread per connection" design scales better than a purely iterative one, but it still contains multiple inefficiencies and will struggle past a point. From a standpoint of underlying [system resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_resource "System resource"), each new thread or process imposes [overhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(computing) "Overhead (computing)") costs in [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory "Computer memory") and processing time (due to [context switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch "Context switch")). The fundamental inefficiency of each thread waiting for I/O to finish isn't resolved either.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Schmidt_1995-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Devresse_2014-2)

From a design standpoint, both approaches [tightly couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_coupling "Tight coupling") the general demultiplexer with specific request handlers too, making the server code brittle and tedious to modify. These considerations suggest a few major design decisions:
1. Retain a single-threaded event handler; multi-threading introduces overhead and complexity without resolving the real issue of blocking I/O
2. Use an event notification mechanism to demultiplex requests only _after_ I/O is complete (so I/O is effectively non-blocking)
3. Register request handlers as [callbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming) "Callback (computer programming)") with the event handler for better [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concern)

# Usage
The reactor pattern can be a good starting point for any concurrent, event-handling problem. The pattern is not restricted to network sockets either; hardware I/O, [file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system "File system") or [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database "Database") access, [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication "Inter-process communication"), and even abstract [message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing "Message passing") systems are all possible use-cases.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

However, the reactor pattern does have limitations, a major one being the use of callbacks, which make [program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis "Program analysis") and [debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging "Debugging") more difficult, a problem common to designs with [inverted control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control "Inversion of control").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Schmidt_1995-1) The simpler thread-per-connection and fully iterative approaches avoid this and can be valid solutions if scalability or high-throughput are not required.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-6)[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Single-threading can also become a drawback in use-cases that require maximum throughput, or when requests involve significant processing. Different multi-threaded designs can overcome these limitations, and in fact, some still use the reactor pattern as a sub-component for handling events and I/O.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern#cite_note-Schmidt_1995-1)
